# Library Manager
Just many lines of code doing nothing in particular. Practicing TypeScript in the steps of Brice Wilson in his [TypeScript In-depth](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/typescript-in-depth/table-of-contents) tutorial on Pluralsight.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
- Just clone this repository by typing: `git clone https://github.com/Lemmah/library-manager.git`
- Switch to project directory: `cd library-manager`
- Install packages by running `npm install`. Wait, you have to have some stuff before you get to this point. So these are:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v8.12.0 and above.
- Npm for package management, this comes with node.
Just type:
```
node -v
```
in your terminal and if its not greater than or equal to v8.12.0, you're not in big trouble, there are tons of tutorials to get up up and running with these. Just grub one then come back when done.

### Installing
Install `typescript` and `ts-node` globally. 
All packages are installed by `npm install`.
Run `npm run serve` to view the application. Visit `localhost:3000`
